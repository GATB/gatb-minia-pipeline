GATB-Pipeline
-------------

Only compatible with Linux64 for now.

Reasons:
- SSPACE shipping with bowtie pre-compiled
- estimate-insert-size needs bwa, so I'm shipping a linux64 version

installation:

    1) Prerequisite: Python >= 2.5 and R.
    2) Type `make`

usage:

    ./gatb -p read_1.fastq read_2.fastq [..]


Many more input options are available. Type `./gatb` for extended usage.
Type `make test` to launch a small test.
